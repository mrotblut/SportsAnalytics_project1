# Executive Summary

Rushing offense is one of the most heavily analyzed aspects of football. The role and impact of a run game in an offense has changed significantly over the past decade. While its role in the NFL is becoming more well defined, college football rushing attacks are utilized in different ways, and one that has yet to be thoroughly evaluated within a quantitative lense. To do this, we aim to quantify Quarterback (QB) and Running Back (RB) impact through Expected Points Added (EPA) to understand individual QB and RB impacts to their teams expected points, and furthermore, their teams wins. We started by gathering play-by-play rushing data and contextual information on all FBS RB's and designed runs/scrambles from QB's from the 2024 regular season. Using past information on RB's and QB's as well as their EPA through the regular season, we aim to predict how much expected points they would add in the future, accounting for the conference they play in, defenses they faced, and other situational factors such as redzone plays, opposing rushing defense latent ability, offensive pass strength and home advantage. 

From our framework, we were able to estimate how many points a QB and RB add over an "average" player, a replacement player. To calculate the value of a replacement level RB, we found the average number of RB's to appear in a game across each conference, and multiplied this value across the number of teams in each conference. Using this product as a threshold, we established that all players above this threshold in terms of snap count were considered non-replacement players, and all players below the threshold were classified as replacement players. Averaging our point estimates for all replacement players in each conference, we were able to establish how many points a replacement RB would add. For QB's, we considered the number of teams as the snap count threshold for replacement vs non replacement (i.e Big Ten has 18 teams, so the top 18 QB's in the Big Ten by snap count were considered non-replacement, and all other QB's were considered as replacement level players).  We then translated points to wins by estimating how much points and score differential have an impact on wins. Using both points added above replacement players by conference (IPAR), as well as wins above replacement players (WAR), we can analyze how much value QB's and RB's add through their rushing abilities. 


# Technical Summary 

We began by loading the necessary libraries and pulling data from the cfbfastR and CollegeFootballData API packages. This includes rosters, team metadata, conference affiliations, and play-by-play (PBP) data for the 2024 FBS season. Here we also identified Notre Dame as Big Ten and UConn as ACC to avoid leaving both as Independent and to assist our sample size. 

```{r}
rosters <- load_cfb_rosters(seasons = 2024)
conferences <- cfbd_conferences()
teams <- cfbd_team_info()
pbp <- load_cfb_pbp(seasons = 2024)
teams$conference[teams$school == "Notre Dame"] <- "Big Ten"
teams$conference[teams$school == "UConn"] <- "ACC"
```

We filtered the dataset to rushing plays from the regular season, ensured IDs were characters, and merged roster information to attach names and positions.

```{r}
rushes <- pbp %>%
  filter(rush == 1) %>%
  filter(season_type == "regular") 
rushes$rush_player_id <- as.character(rushes$rush_player_id)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
defeff <- rushes %>%
  group_by(def_pos_team) %>%
  summarise(
    carries = n(),
    efficiency = mean(EPA, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(carries >= 150) %>%
  arrange((efficiency))


rosterids <- rosters %>%
  mutate(
    name = paste(first_name, last_name, sep = " ")
  ) %>%
  select(name, team, position, athlete_id)

rosterids <- rosterids %>%
  filter(!(name == "Micah Davis" & team == "Utah State"))


rushes <- rushes %>%
  left_join(rosterids, by = c("rush_player_id" = "athlete_id"))

teaminfo <- rosterids %>%
  left_join(teams, by = c("team" = "school"))
```


We next defined replacement level players within each conference. RB thresholds were set at average roster depth Ã— number of teams; QB thresholds equaled the number of teams in the conference. Players below thresholds were considered replacement level. 


```{r}
rbs <- rushes %>%
  filter(position %in% c("RB")) %>%
  group_by(pos_team, position, conference, rusher_player_name) %>%
  summarize(
    rush_attempts = n(),
    total_rush_epa = sum(EPA, na.rm = TRUE),
    epa_per_rush = mean(EPA, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(pos_team, desc(rush_attempts)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(rusher_player_name))

confrbs <- rbs %>%
  group_by(conference, pos_team) %>%
  summarise(
    RBS = n()
  ) %>%
  group_by(conference) %>%
  summarise(
    teams = n(),
    avgRBS = 4
  ) %>%
  filter(conference %in% c("American Athletic", "ACC", "Big 12", "Big Ten", "Conference USA",
                           "FBS Independents", "Mid-American", "Mountain West", "Pac-12",
                           "SEC", "Sun Belt")) %>%
  mutate(
    slicenum = teams * avgRBS
  )
```

We then added contextual variables: Opponent conference, QB run indicator, home field, passing strength of each offense, and opponent defensive stuff rate.

```{r}
rushes <- rushes %>%
  left_join(teams, by = c("def_pos_team" = "school"))

rushes <- rushes %>%
  rename(oppConf = conference.y)

rushes <- rushes %>%
  filter(conference.x %in% c("American Athletic", "ACC", "Big 12", "Big Ten", "Conference USA",
                             "FBS Independents", "Mid-American", "Mountain West", "Pac-12",
                             "SEC", "Sun Belt"))

rushes <- rushes %>%
  mutate(
    qbRun = ifelse(position == "QB", 1, 0)
  )


rushes <- rushes %>%
  mutate(
    homeTeam = ifelse(pos_team == home, 1, 0)
  )

pass_strength <-
  pbp |>
  filter(pass == 1) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(pos_team) |>
  dplyr::summarise(pass_strength = mean(EPA, na.rm = TRUE))

rushes <-
  rushes |>
  dplyr::inner_join(pass_strength, by = "pos_team") 


qbRuns <- rushes %>%
  filter(qbRun == 1) 


rushesfilter <- rushes %>%
  filter(qbRun == 0)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
rushesfilter <- rushesfilter %>%
  select(game_id, id_play, rush_player_id, score_diff_start, qbRun, conference.x,passer_player_name, pos_team, oppConf, def_pos_team, homeTeam, rz_play, epa_success,
         EPA, conference_game, stuffed_run, pass_strength)

qbRuns <- qbRuns %>%
  select(game_id, id_play, rush_player_id,score_diff_start, qbRun, conference.x, passer_player_name, pos_team, oppConf, def_pos_team, homeTeam, rz_play, epa_success,
         EPA, conference_game, stuffed_run, pass_strength)
```


```{r}
rushStuffRate <- rushesfilter %>%
  group_by(def_pos_team) %>%
  summarise(
    defStuffRate = mean(stuffed_run, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
qbStuffRate <- qbRuns %>%
  group_by(def_pos_team) %>%
  summarise(
    defStuffRate = mean(stuffed_run, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
rushesfilter <-
  rushesfilter |>
  dplyr::inner_join(rushStuffRate, by = "def_pos_team") 

qbRuns <-
  qbRuns |>
  dplyr::inner_join(qbStuffRate, by = "def_pos_team") 

rushesfilter <- rushesfilter %>%
  mutate(
    rush_player_id = factor(rush_player_id),
    pos_team = factor(pos_team),
    def_pos_team = factor(def_pos_team),
    oppConf = factor(oppConf)
  )

qbRuns <- qbRuns %>%
  mutate(
    rush_player_id = factor(rush_player_id),
    pos_team = factor(pos_team),
    def_pos_team = factor(def_pos_team),
    oppConf = factor(oppConf))
```


To estimate player contributions to EPA, we fit linear mixed-effects models for QB and RB runs. Random effects captured player variation, while fixed effects included home field, pass strength, red zone, defensive stuff rate, score differential, and opponent conference.

```{r}
qbrun_fit <-
  lmer(EPA ~ 1 + (1 | rush_player_id) + homeTeam + pass_strength + rz_play + 
         defStuffRate + score_diff_start + oppConf,,
       data = qbRuns)

summary(qbrun_fit)
nonqb_run_fit <-
  lmer(EPA ~ 1 + (1 | rush_player_id) + homeTeam + pass_strength + rz_play + 
         defStuffRate + score_diff_start + oppConf,,
       data = rushesfilter)

summary(nonqb_run_fit)
```

From these models, we extracted Impact Per Attempt (IPA) for each player, then multiplied by usage (number of attempts) to compute Impact Per Attempt Accumulated (IPAA).

qbwar %>%

```

Limitations:

- This WAR metric only accounts for rushing, not passing or receiving due to lack of play-by-play data provided at the college level. 

- Since there are only 2 independent teams, Notre Dame was moved to Big Ten and UConn was moved to ACC. 

- Replacement thresholds are heuristics; applying different definitions of replacement could change the results.

- The linear mixed-effects model does not capture interactive variables such as QB mobility vs defensive schemes.

- Only the regular season statistics were used during this development.

Next Steps:
